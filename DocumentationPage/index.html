        <p>What is Python?<br>
            Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

            It is used for:

            web development (server-side),
            software development,
            mathematics,
            system scripting.<br></p>

        <p>What can Python do?<br>
            Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
            Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
            Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
            Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
            Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development. </p>
        <p>Why Python?<br>
            Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
            Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
            Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming
            languages.
            Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means
            that prototyping can be very quick.
            Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.</p>
        <p>Good to know <br>
            The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial. However,
            Python
            2, although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular.
            In this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. It is possible to write Python in an Integrated
            Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when
            managing larger collections of Python files.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Python_history">
        <header>Python history</header>
        <p>Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the
            Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL, capable of
            exception handling (from the start plus new capabilities in Python 3.11) and interfacing with the Amoeba
            operating system. Its implementation began in December 1989. Van Rossum shouldered sole
            responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his "permanent
            vacation" from his responsibilities as Python's "benevolent dictator for life", a title the Python community
            bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker. In January
            2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.</p>
        <p>Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features. Python 3.0, released on 3
            December 2008, with many of its major features backported to Python 2.6.x and 2.7.x. Releases of Python
            3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.</p>
        <p>Python 2.7's end-of-life was initially set for 2015, then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body
            of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3. No further security patches or
            other improvements will be released for it. Currently only 3.7 and later are supported. In 2021,
            Python 3.9.2 and 3.8.8 were expedited as all versions of Python (including 2.7) had security issues
            leading to possible remote code execution and web cache poisoning.</p>
        <p>In 2022, Python 3.10.4 and 3.9.12 were expedited and 3.8.13, and 3.7.13, because of many security
            issues. When Python 3.9.13 was released in May 2022, it was announced that the 3.9 series (joining the
            older series 3.8 and 3.7) will only receive security fixes going forward. On September 7, 2022, four new
            releases were made due to a potential denial-of-service attack: 3.10.7, 3.9.14, 3.8.14, and
            3.7.14.</p>
        <p>As of November 2022, Python 3.11.0 is the current stable release and among the notable changes from 3.10 are
            that it is 10â€“60% faster and significantly improved error reporting.</p>
        <p>Python 3.12 (alpha 2) has improved error messages.</p>

        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language.
            Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its
            environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
        <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language
            elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a
            variety of
            purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p><br>
        <p>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document
            Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML
            form
            and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</p><br>
        <p>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a
            server.
            For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity
            of
            information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
            server.</p>

        <p>The history of Java is very interesting. Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was
            too
            advanced technology for the digital cable television industry at the time. The history of Java starts with
            the
            Green Team. Java team members (also known as Green Team), initiated this project to develop a language for
            digital devices such as set-top boxes, televisions, etc. However, it was best suited for internet
            programming.
            Later, Java technology was incorporated by Netscape.</p>
        <p>The principles for creating Java programming were "Simple, Robust, Portable, Platform-independent, Secured,
            High
            Performance, Multithreaded, Architecture Neutral, Object-Oriented, Interpreted, and Dynamic". Java was
            developed
            by James Gosling, who is known as the father of Java, in 1995. James Gosling and his team members started
            the
            project in the early '90s.</p>
        <p>Currently, Java is used in internet programming, mobile devices, games, e-business solutions, etc. Following
            are
            given significant points that describe the history of Java.</p>
